## 📌 Overview

This repository contains all resources related to our research work on deploying a **real-time calamity detection system using TinyML on ESP32**. The model detects disasters such as floods, fires, building collapse, and traffic accidents from aerial images captured via UAVs and uses onboard GPS for geolocation. All processing is done on-device using a quantized MobileNetV2 model, ensuring edge-only operation without cloud dependency.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Lightweight **MobileNetV2** model optimized for **ESP32-S3**
- ✅ Input image support for **96×96×3** and **126×126×3**
- ✅ Real-time **on-device inference (~1.1 FPS)**
- ✅ Uses **AIDER dataset** (5 disaster classes + normal)
- ✅ **Quantization** with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers
- ✅ **Custom focal loss** and **dynamic learning rate scheduling**
- ✅ Integrated **GPS geolocation** + **store-and-forward communication**
- ✅ Compatible with **UAVs and tower installations**

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- MobileNetV2 (α=0.25) as base
- Lightweight custom classifier head:
  - Flatten → Dense(256, ReLU) → Dropout(0.3) → Dense(5, Softmax)
- Loss: **Custom Focal Loss** (α=0.2, γ=1.5)
- Learning Rate: **Custom decaying scheduler**
- Exported as `.tflite` and converted to C array for deployment
